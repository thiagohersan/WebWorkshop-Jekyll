XOXOXOLOLOLOL is a project of projects; an exploration into the possibilities of post-internet connection, communication and affection.

It starts with the recognition of the internet as an experiment that we conduct on ourselves, with all of its (commercial, personal, political) ramifications and (cultural, psychological, economic) consequences, and the need for other networks, interfaces, organisms and agential systems that take into account the desires created by our present forms of communication.

Physically, it began as a kind of mail art game: participants received a mouth-shaped stamp along with an inkpad and “INSTRUCTIONS” for how to play. The stamps were used in a variety of ways.
